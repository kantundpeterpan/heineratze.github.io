I'm an aspiring data scientist with a keen interest in any application of large-scale computing, 
machine learning and modeling in biology and chemistry. By training, I am a pharmacist holding the 
equivalent of Master's degree in medicinal chemistry from [Friedrich-Schiller-University, Jena 
Germany](https://www.uni-jena.de/en) and a PhD in biochemistry/microbiology from [Sorbonne University, Paris, France](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en).
