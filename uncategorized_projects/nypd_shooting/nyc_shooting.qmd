## Dataset description

Dataset used in this report : [NYPD Shooting Incident Data
(Historic)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Shooting-Incident-Data-Historic-/833y-fsy8)

The data set is a manually curated list of all shooting incidents in NYC
from 2006 through the end of the previous calender year. It contains the
coordinates of the shooting and the corresponding police precinct,
demographic information about victim and perpetrator (if known) and
information about the location of the incident.

## Analysis objective

In a short analysis I will have a look a the trend of gun violence in
the period 2006 - 2022 and its spatial distribution among the 77 NYPD
precincts.

From 2006 the number shooting incidents continuously declined until it
bottomed around 2018. Gun violence then surged in 2020 due to generally
difficult economic conditions, which aggravated in the aftermath of the
coronavirus epidemic.

#### Cumulative spatial distribution of shooting incidents 2006 - 2022

``` r
#calculate no. of incidents per police precinct
total <- data %>% group_by(PRECINCT) %>% count()
```

``` r
#create a map
prec_geo_url = 'https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/c35786feb0ac4d1b964f41f874f151c1_0.geojson'

#download geojson of NYPD police precincts
geo <- geojson_read(prec_geo_url, what = 'sp')

#get geojson dataframe
geo_tidy <- tidy(geo)
```

The polygons corresponding to the police precincts are numbered 1:77 in
the geojson file. Therefore, we need to map the actual precinct codes in
the data to this range.

``` r
total$id <- 1:77
total$id <- as.character(total$id)
```

Now the number of incidents per precinct can be joined with the geodata.

``` r
geo_tidy_all <- geo_tidy %>%
  left_join(total, by = 'id')
```

The `geo_tidy` dataframe is now ready to be used for the creation of the
map.

``` r
ggplot(geo_tidy_all) + 
  geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = n), color = 'black', size = 0.2) +
  scale_fill_viridis_b(trans = "log", breaks = c(1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000)) +
  theme_void() +
  labs(title = "Cumulative spatial distribution of shooting incidents \ngrouped by NYPD precinct",
       subtitle = "2006 - 2022") +
  coord_map()
```

![](images/f2556b2e3d149f2bcc2c785314bbcdcd0dd4931b.png){width="2100"}

``` r
kable(total %>% arrange(desc(n)) %>% select(c(PRECINCT, n)) %>% head())
```

    PRECINCT      n
  ---------- ------
          75   1557
          73   1452
          67   1216
          44   1020
          79   1012
          47    953

Gun violence is clearly spread over the whole city, with hot-spots in
the Bronx and in East New York. The 75th and 73th precinct counted the
highest number of shooting incidents over this period of time. The 75th
precinct was once known as New York's ["Killing
Ground"](https://nypost.com/2022/07/27/this-brooklyn-nypd-precinct-is-the-bloodiest-in-new-york-city/).

Comparing the two maps from 2006 and 2018, clearly shows that there was
a significant reduction in gun violence, also in and around the infamous
75th precinct.

### Additional questions based on the findings

The above findings are merely descriptive but do not investigate
potential causes for the observed distribution and surge of gun violence
in New York City. Further investigations should link the shooting data
to socioeconomic data.
:::
:::

::: {#potential-source-of-bias .section .level2}
## Potential source of bias

The data set contains only shooting incidents that were recorded by the
police and is a convenience sample in the sense that unreported
shootings are registered. As a consequence analyses of this data set are
potentially underestimating the number of shootings.
